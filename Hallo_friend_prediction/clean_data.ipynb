Identify potential problems with the data:\n"," \n","*   Evaluate the source.\n","    *   We received our data straight from the app database, so it is a pretty reliable source of data.\n","    * The issues with this database are the format with which the data was stored and exported. \n","    * We recieved files which were somewhat like json in nature, but we had to format the json first.\n","    * We then had to import the json files and format them for use with pandas\n","*   What makes you think that?  \n","    *    Data from the app is structured and coerced to be in a certain format with standard answers for all users.\n","*   Evaluate potential biases and other problems with the data (e.g. political data gathered by a particular party trying to get a particular result, or positive pharmaceutical data from the company selling the pharmaceutical) What will you do to deal with these problems?\n","    * Potential bias could come from limited data as the app is new, and the user base for the app could be skewed with the newness of the community. Since users of the app are all learning English, there might also be a potential bias in the variety of users.\n","* Are there missing results or other things that look wrong?\n","    * We dropped a few rows that were stored as test data before the app had users but besides that, if the data has missing values, it is in a reasonable column/entry. The data is in good shape.\n"," \n","#### 2.   What are the strengths and weaknesses of using this data set for answering the questions in the proposal.  If it is not suitable, consider adjusting the questions or acquiring new data.\n","* Strengths:\n","    * The features needed for the task of the project were not extremely complex. Due to this and the fact that the data was collected through automation, minimal errors were encountered in the cleaning process.\n","    * Another strength is that we have data on interactions within a user base of around 300,000. This size will allow us to try out and use a significant amount of features for predicting friendship links and retention.\n","    * The data we currently have is rich for feature extraction. We have text, images, and video encapsulating user interaction which could be mined for information through NLP and Computer Vision. Since there could be many factors influencing why someone is not retained in the app, we may to use these techniques to infer more about the person to better predict and understand why they leave.\n","    \n"," \n","* Weaknesses:\n","    * Time series analysis assumes patterns of past can be used to infer patterns of future. This assumption may not be true with the type of community described by our data. Specifically, our data encompases the initial growth of the community which has many obviously inherent biases such as who initially downloaded the app and how much their intents lined up with the that of the app. Perhaps there exists a different set of initial users that would result in a more successful cascade of naturally forming friendships. Such could render all time series data of the past irrelevant in predicting the strongest factors of friendship in the future.\n","    * In the case of time series data being relevant, there are some data that lack time stamps which could be a significant loss.\n","    * For obvious reasons, personal data such as culture, religion, and interests, often used in community analysis, is not available to us. This will make it more difficult to predict community interactions.\n","    * We lack data on lasting relationships from students to teachers and so we will have to create an evolving model with regards to suggesting teachers to students. \n","    \n","#### 3. Revise any other aspects of your proposal in light of what you have learned from examining the data.\n","* \n","    * After examining the data, it appears that we have enough to still answer the questions we proposed, thus no changes to our proposal are necessary at this time.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"-jrD_OvT7aAi","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["# The file
