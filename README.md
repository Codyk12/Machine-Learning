# Machine Learning Projects
All my machine learning projects 

1. IMDB Moving Rating Prediction:
  Crowd ratings are often more reliable than critic ratings, which is why this project attempts to regress or classify on movie information to predict the crowd rating.
2. Hallo Spam Detection
  In an effort to help Hallo, a global english language learning platform, grow detecting and ejecting spammers is crucial. We classify and predict users which are spammers using almost every machine learning trick under the sun and come out with some pretty good results.
3. Hallo Friend Prediction:
  Developed friendship indicators with the purpose of developing a friend recommendation machine learning system for Hallo's Online Community to promote growth and retention. 
4. P&G Factory Failure Prediction:
  Built a Neural Network to predict uptimes of factory lines in a diaper manufacturing plant and used statistical modeling to determine which lines are under preforming. This helps predict when and where to save money, time and manpower.
